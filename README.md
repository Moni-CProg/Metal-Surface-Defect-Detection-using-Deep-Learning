# Metal-Surface-Defect-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
The metal surface of machinery plays a role in numerous industries, including automotive, in today bustling environment. A defective metal surface lowers the performance and quality of the product. The surface examination is done manually or using crude automated techniques, but the issue cannot be entirely resolved due to external variables. This study proposes a novel method for metal surface recognition utilizing deep learning approaches, namely Convolution Neural Network (CNN) combined with self-attention mechanisms. It aims to enhance the ability of the model to recognize minute details that are essential for precise detection. The self-attention modules enable the network to capture complex patterns and spatial relationships by choosing focusing on specific areas within metal surface dataset, enhancing sensitivity to difficult conditions.
